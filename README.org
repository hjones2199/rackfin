* Info
Provides racket bindings to the finnhub API. Project is currently just a single file, without
the necessary structure or stability to place in the racket repositories. A valid API key from
[[https://finnhub.io][Finnhub]] is needed to make use of this library. I'm currently only implementing the free tier API
functions.
